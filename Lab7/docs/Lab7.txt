7.1
The minimum amount of time that data_ready must remain asserted to ensure correct coperation is 2 clock cycles. In this case, one clock cycle is set to be 8ns, therefore, the minimum amount of time is 16ns. 

The minimum amount of time that data must remain valid after data_ready is asserted in order to ensure correct operation is 3 clock cycles. 


7.2
The color of each is different from others, and it appears that the first image emphasizes more on the vertical features, whereas the second image emphasizes more on the horizontal features. The third one treats all line features more equally. It does make sense, since in the testbench, for each image, it analyzes and applies filter to one of the r, g and b scale of the pixel. The third image is generated by merging all the color scale including the first and the second image.
